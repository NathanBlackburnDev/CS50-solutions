                    Breaking Bad is my second favorite show. It is the highest rated show on IMDb and regarded as one of the best TV shows of all time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The show's premise is about a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walter White. Due to his finanical situation,
                    he decides to start selling meth with his former student, Jesse Pinkman. What I find think is so great about Breaking Bad is how crazy the show starts
                    to get. It has many incredible twists and incredibly suprising dark moments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The show is incredibly suprising and tense, quite littearly every episode has some kind of incredible twist or philisophical meaning behind it. The characters
                    are some of the most well written of all media ever. The show also does not have a good ending, which I always like.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think this show is an absoulete must watch, and is one of the best TV shows of all time, and will remain one of the best TV shows of all time. The breaking Bad
                    universe is so interesting and is by far my favorite franchise ever. This show ended 11 years ago, yet it still holds itself up and blows anything that is made today
                    well out of the water.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What makes Breaking Bad so unique, and so incredible is how dark and twisted it gets. You see the incredibly shrimpy high school chemistry teacher become a 
                    murdureous drug kingpin, with absouletely no regard or thought for others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Season 5 is my favorite season. I believe this is when it becomes its most dark and interesting. It is difficult to watch this show and not binge watch it.
