                    Better Call Saul is my favorite show. It is the prequel to Breaking Bad (my second favorite show), and takes place in the early 2000's.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The show is mainly focused on James Morgan Mcgill and his slow transition into Saul Goodman, it also shows a fair amount of history on one of
                    Breaking Bad's most mysterious characters, Gus Fring and his partnership with Mike Ehrmantraut. It introduces new characters like Kim Whexler,
                    Lalo Salamanca and Nacho Varga which are some of the most well-written characters, I believe in all media ever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The cinematography, and story telling in this series is just incredible, and I believe in many ways is better than Breaking Bad. I will grant you
                    that it does have a slow start, and is at times a bit confusing but I really believe the show finds its stride towards the end of season 1. Season 6
                    of Better Call Saul was highly regarded as one of the best final seasons of a TV show ever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I genuienly could not recommend this show enough, and I think it was the perfect way to end the Breaking Bad franchise and give it the perfect sendoff
                    (except for the pop corners add). The show is a Netflix original, which is suprising because they usually produce pure shit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What I believe makes Better Call Saul so good, is it not focused purley on letting you know that it is the Breaking Bad prequel, it has its own universe,
                    completely seperate from Breaking Bad. It has this incredibly unique and fresh twist that is often not seen in TV shows (including Breaking Bad). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My favourite season is, of course, season 6. And my favorite character is Lalo Salamanca, besides Nacho Varga. This is a show I will re-watch many times.
