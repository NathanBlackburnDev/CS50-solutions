                    The Sopranos is my 3rd favorite show. Unfortunately, I cannot give a fully accurate review, as I have only seen the 1st season. But I believe
                    that should be a testiment to how good this show is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The show is about the New Jersey Mafia. After the death of the former boss, Jackie. Corrado "Junior" Soprano is put in place. This causes some unrest
                    within the mafia, as capo Tony Soprano is secretly running the mafia behind the scenes. Tony Soprano's mental state is rapidll deterating and he goes to 
                    see a physcologist. When word gets out about his psychologist, his uncle and mother try to whack him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From what I have seen of the Sopranos, it is incredible. It is so unbelivebly interesting and is very accurate to how actual mafias operate. What I find
                    the most interesting is how easily everyone is to consider killing someone. Tony Sopranos own mother and uncle try to kill him and dont look back on it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would recommend this show because it is regarded as again one of the best and most influential TV shows of all time, but also because of what I have seen
                    is great. And given that any show during its first season is usually very shit because it is finding its footing, it is clear The Sopranos was planned out
                    well in advance and as a result it gives a great first season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Every episode of season 1 I have thoroughly enjoyed. The Sopranos is so incredibly iconic, from the theme song to the characters and the word "whack". Everyone
                    is familiar with the Sopranos. Once again, this TV show is very old, but is still so much better than the shite put out today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I predict I will rewatch this show many times. And I look forward to it.
