Generally I would consider their audio era as positive and upbeat. There was a lot of music in there that was happy and sort of
celebratory music. A lot of the songs were feel good type music too. However there was also some sad songs in there about various
challanges such as relationships and addiction etc.

The way I have calculated this aura may not be representative about the listner because they could (and most likely are) listening
to the music regardless of how they feel, and if they are playing the top 50 songs playlist which is made by spotify then they probably
are not going to care that much about the music or generally pay attention to the meaning behind the song. They could just like sad songs
even when they are happy or just listen to the more upbeat and positive songs when they are sad to try and change how they are feeling.

A better way of calculating this aura would be to potentially look at a wider range of music that they are listening to, see what time
they are listening to the music and try to find out their listening habits and then conduct studies on the type of music people listen
to during what period of the year and what time of the day and how that could be reflective of their emotions.
