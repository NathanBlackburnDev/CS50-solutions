Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

The more I run the simulations the faster they will be, they actually sometimes got slower the more I did them. For example,
when I ran 1000 simulations 5 times, the fastest it ran was 28 seconds and the slowest it ran (most recent) was 32 seconds.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I would say anything after 10 simulations is good enough, after that you get one of two simulations where one is belgium has
the highest probability of winning and the other is brazil has the highest probability of winning
